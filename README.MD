<h1>there is vite inside all of us</h1>
<h1>everyone has a little bit of vite in them</h1>
<h2>NEEDS REVIEWING</h2>
<p>Look into MARKDOWN to write better READMEs. <br>
Look into mapping() and keys (VERY IMPORTANT) <br>
Look into importing as {} from a components folder after creating an index.js that exports from the components folder (look for the answer to why we do that specifically instead of importing from index.js) <br>
Review the way styles.js was coded for objects that hold tailwind utility classes <br>
Review the ? : notation, alongside the - 1 to stop at the end when coding inside the map/key functions regarding the margins <br>
Review a href = {`#${nav.id`} <br>
Review the call function for State onClick <br>
Review tailwindcss.config.cjs module.exports for theme extensions and the docs related <br>
Review div layout css and use FIGMA INSPECT to better understand and visualize <br>
Review styles.js dynamic classes <br>
Look into Filmpire App Tutorial to better understand mobile optimization and how the individual utilizes built in tailiwindcss utility classes when it comes to coding for PC vs. Mobile (ss, mm) <br>
Work very hard or prob end up like Frank or Jasper gg.
